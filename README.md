# Findmeacomp

This is a small website on which we have worked to get the basic idea of how web dev works.

Find our website on: Findmeacomp.in(or whatever)

# Roadmap

* Create the basic layout of whole website
* Work on the scrapers for all the websites
* test all the scrapers
* Setup the basic front end
* link scrapers with front end
* write docs and tests for the code
* BOOM apki website taiyaar hai

This is a rough roadmap don't take it seriously jo bhai bolega vahi karna tum log !!


# How to run the webstie locally

* Make sure you have installed all the dependencies
* From terminanl go to `Findmeacomp` folder and run
`export FLASK_APP=Findmeacomp`
* Then Run:
    - `flask run`

    And you'll have a link to you're local host hosting the website
