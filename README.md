# Findmeacomp

This is a small website on which we have worked to get the basic idea of how web dev works.
This is written in python and flask

# Run locally

* You need python3

* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/mzfr/Findmeacomp`

* Change directory - `cd Findmeacomp/`

* Install all the dependencies:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Set Flask variable: `export FLASK_APP=Findmeacomp.py`

* Then Run:
    - `flask run`

    And you'll have a link to you're local host hosting the website

__NOTE__

If you are using pipenv then instead of running `flask run` use
`pipenv run flask run`
